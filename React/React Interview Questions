Native Web Components
What are the most common approaches for styling a React application?
Control & Uncontrolled Components
Strict Mode (React.StrictMode)
why can’t the component directly return multiple elements.
why do the Component names in JSX start with capital letter
Error Boundary
Render Props
Class based Lifecycle Methods
Class Components
Keys
What are the main 2 types of components you can declare in React, and when would you use one over another
why do we need to import React from 'react' on the top of the file even if we don’t use React in our code;
If you wanted a component to perform an action only once when the component initially rendered—e.g., make a web analytics call—how would you achieve this with a class component? And how would you achieve it with a function component?
how would you go about making sure the data is not re-fetched when the component is re-mounted
The cycle of mounting a stateful component? What functions are called in what order? Where would you place a request for data from the API? Why? (getDerivedStateFromProps)
why componentDidMount and not constructor? (“with the new asynchronous rendering in React Fiber …”)
how would you go about passing data across multiple levels of depth, without passing it from component to component? (Context, function-as-child pattern)
What is the StrictMode component and why would you use it?
Pure Functional Components
React Hooks
What is prop drilling and how can you avoid it?
explain the idea of “lifting the state up”?
State
Concurrent Rendering
React.memo
Pure Components
Higher-Order Components || HoCs in React? (Redux -> connect)
Virtual DOM
Pros & Cons
Synthetic Events
Reconcilization
Portal
refs
JSX
Prop Drilling
Difference in Props & State
Functional Components
Handle Events in React
Passing Data between Components (Props, Context API, Callbacks, Redux)
